# Internet Speed Simulator
There is a surprising lack of tools available for simulating the download speeds of different internet connections, without having access to good internet or throttling your own connection. The tools that _are_ available focus on heavier use cases, like downloading large game files, thousands of photos, or hundreds of songs, all taking dozens of gigabytes of data. When you don't have access to broadband internet, however, or when your data needs are quite a bit lighter, you'll be less focused on these heavier use cases and more on your average, daily usage, like loading web pages and looking at memes.

When your connection gets throttled down to fractions of a megabit per second, what does that look like? How does it impact even the lightest of internet users? Just how bad is your friend's internet that you keep hearing about? What does "fast" internet look like? How much would that service upgrade improve your quality of life? This tool, currently in its proof-of-concept stages, seeks to help in answering these kinds of questions.
